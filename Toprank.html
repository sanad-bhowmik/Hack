                          <p class="card-text">A seminal figure in American hacking, Kevin Mitnick got his career start as a teen. In 1981, he was charged with stealing computer manuals from Pacific Bell. In 1982, he hacked the North American Defense Command (NORAD), an achievement that inspired the 1983 film War Games. In 1989, he hacked Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) network and made copies of their software. Because DEC was a leading computer manufacturer at the time, this act put Mitnick on the map. He was later arrested, convicted and sent to prison. During his conditional release, he hacked Pacific Bell's voicemail systems.</p>

                          <h5 class="card-title" style="margin-left: 200px;">Anonymous</h5>
                          <p class="card-text">Anonymous got its start in 2003 on 4chan message boards in an unnamed forum. The group exhibits little organization and is loosely focused on the concept of social justice. For example, in 2008 the group took issue with the Church of Scientology and begin disabling their websites, thus negatively impacting their search rankings in Google and overwhelming its fax machines with all-black images. In March 2008, a group of "Anons" marched passed Scientology centers around the world wearing the now-famous Guy Fawkes mask. The lack of any real hierarchy makes it almost impossible to identify or eliminate Anonymous as a whole.HACKTIVIST COLLECTIVE ANONYMOUS claims to have obtained gigabytes of data from Epik, which provides domain name, hosting, and DNS services for a variety of clients. These include the Texas GOP, Gab, Parler, and 8chan, among other right-wing sites. The hacktivist collective says that the data set, which is over 180 GB in size, contains a "decade's worth of data from the company.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Jonathan James, a prolific young hacker that was hacking NASA at night while being at school in the morning. He went on to be the first juvenile to be sentenced federally to a term of confinement for computer hacking.At the age of 15, James had enough with hacking his educational institutions and set bigger hacking goals. Between June 23, 1999, and October 27, 1999, he committed a series of intrusions into various systems.
                            His first target was AT&T BellSouth, one of the largest telecommunications companies at the time in the US.
                            The hacking details are not completely known, but C0mrade hacked into the companyâ€™s servers without doing any damage. His main goal was not to profit or stealing information but more about testing his hacking abilities on a bigger target like AT&T Bellsouth.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">On June 1, 1990, Poulsen took over all of the telephone lines for Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, guaranteeing that he would be the 102nd caller and win the prize of a Porsche 944 S2.
                            When the Federal Bureau of Investigation started pursuing Poulsen, he went underground as a fugitive. A storage company cleared out a storage shed in Poulsen's name due to non-payment of rent, where computer equipment was discovered which was furnished to the FBI for evidence. When he was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, the show's 1-800 telephone lines mysteriously crashed.Poulsen was arrested in April 1991 following an investigation led in part by John McClurg.Although Chris Lamprecht was sentenced first with an internet ban on May 5, 1995, Poulsen was released from prison before Lamprecht and began serving his ban sentence earlier. (Poulsen's parole officer later allowed him to use the Internet in 2004, with certain monitoring restrictions)</p>
